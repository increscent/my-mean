Javascript Objects
===================

Write a function that adds together all the numbers in this javascript object, and then returns this result.

```
var ticket = {
	red: 4,
	green: 6,
	blue: 9,
	purple: [3, 8, 2, 5]
};
```


Your function should work with this one too:

```
var ticket = {
	penguin: 13,
	vulture: 7,
	robin: 16,
	velociraptor: [23, 28, 22, 25]
};
```
